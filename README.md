# Project Goals 
The concept for the BookWish website stemmed from observing the needs of my book-loving family and friends. As avid readers, they constantly seek out new books, discovering titles they're drawn to but often face challenges in obtaining or reading them. Additionally, they struggle to keep track of their growing list of desired reads. I've witnessed friends excitedly stumble upon a book they fancy, only to forget about it later due to lack of a tracking system. Recognizing this common dilemma among readers, I envisioned BookWish as a solution, empowering users to effortlessly compile and manage their book wishlist in one convenient platform.

# User Authentication

User authentication is a crucial aspect of the BookWish website, ensuring that only authorized users have access to their personalized book wishlist. The authentication process involves registration, login, and session management to authenticate and authorize users securely.

## Registration

New users can register for an account by providing a unique username and a secure password. Upon registration, the user's credentials are securely stored in the database using password hashing to maintain confidentiality.

## Login

Registered users can log in to their accounts using their username and password. The login credentials are verified against the stored user data in the database. If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and granted access to their personalized wishlist.

## Session Management

Session management is employed to maintain user authentication throughout their interaction with the website. Upon successful login, a session is established, allowing the user to navigate between pages without the need for reauthentication. Sessions are securely managed using Flask's session mechanism, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.

## Password Security

User passwords are securely hashed using the `generate_password_hash` function provided by Werkzeug. This ensures that passwords are not stored in plain text and cannot be retrieved even by the website administrators. When users log in, the hashed password stored in the database is compared with the hashed version of the password provided during login using the `check_password_hash` function, ensuring secure authentication.

## Access Control

Access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive pages and functionalities, such as the user's wishlist. Only authenticated users are allowed to view, add, edit, or delete books from their wishlist. Unauthorized access attempts are redirected to the login page, ensuring the privacy and security of user data.

# Deployment

The BookWish website has been successfully deployed on Heroku, utilizing ElephantSQL for its database management. Below are the steps involved in the deployment process:

## ElephantSQL Setup

1. **Create ElephantSQL Account**:
    - Sign up for an ElephantSQL account.
    - Click “Create New Instance” and set up your plan.
    - Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan, choose a name, and region.
    - Review your details and click “Create instance”.
    - Copy the database URL from the dashboard.
2. **Prepare Heroku Files**:
    - Generate a `requirements.txt` (contains a list of the Python dependencies that your project needs in order to run successfully) file with `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`. After you run this command a new file called requirements.txt should appear in your root directory.
    - Heroku requires a Procfile containing a command to run your program. Inside the root directory of your project create the new file. It must be called Procfile with a capital P, otherwise Heroku won’t recognise it. Inside the file add the command `web: python run.py`. Ensure you do not add a blank line to the end of the file as this can cause problems for deployment
3. **Configure Database URL**:
    - Open your `__init__.py` file and adjust `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`. Add an if statement before the line setting the SLQALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and, in the else, set the value to reference a new variable, `DATABASE_URL`.

        ```python
        app = Flask(__name__)
        app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")

        if os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT") == "True":
            app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DB_URL")
        else:
            app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
        ```

    - To ensure that SQLAlchemy can also read your external database, its URL needs to start with “postgresql://”, but you should not change this in the environment variable. Instead,  make an addition to your else statement from the previous step to adjust your `DATABASE_URL` in case it starts with `postgres://`: 

        ```python
        if os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT") == "True":
            app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DB_URL")
        else:
            uri = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
            if uri.startswith("postgres://"):
                uri = uri.replace("postgres://", "postgresql://", 1)
            app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = uri
        ```

    - Save all your files and then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub.

Now that you have your database and code in your IDE configured, you will need to add it to a Heroku app using a new environment variable (Config Var) called `DATABASE_URL`. Then your Heroku app will be able to connect to the external database.

## Heroku Deployment

1. **Create a Heroku App**:
    - Log into Heroku.com and click “New” > “Create a new app”.
    - Choose a unique name and region, then click “Create app”.
2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - Go to the Settings tab of your app.
    - Click "Reveal Config Vars" and return to your ElephantSQL tab and copy your database URL. 
    - Back on Heroku, add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste your ElephantSQL database URL in as the value. Make sure you click “Add”
    - Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var. 
    - Reminder to not wrap strings in quotes when adding them as values to Heroku Config Vars.
3. **Deploy from GitHub**:
    - Navigate to the “Deploy” tab of your app.
    - In the Deployment method section select “Connect to GitHub”, search for your repo and click Connect 
    - You can click Enable Automatic Deploys in case you make any further changes to the project. This will trigger any time code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
    - To manually deploy go to the manual deploy section and click deploy branch.
    - Click “Deploy Branch” to start the build process. This will start the build process. 
4. **Initialize Database Tables**:
    - Click “More” > “Run console” in your Heroku app.
    - Type `python3` into the console and run.
    - Enter the Python terminal and create tables with `from your_app import db` and `db.create_all()`.
    - Exit the Python terminal and close the console.

**Note**: If you make changes to your models during development, you will need to make these migrations again in the Heroku console.

The app should be up and running now, so click the “Open app” button.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your app to Heroku!

  - Stack Overflow, Flask Documentation, and PostgreSQL Documentation were used to build the search functionality. Stack Overflow provided various threads that offered solutions and insights into implementing search queries in Flask applications. The Flask Documentation was instrumental in understanding how to handle requests, perform database queries, and render templates. PostgreSQL Documentation helped in utilizing the ILIKE operator for case-insensitive searches in the database.

# Potential Future Additions

In consideration of potential future developments, the following features may be added to enhance the BookWish platform:

1. **Read Page**: Implementation of a dedicated "Read" page where users can transition books from their wishlist after completion. This feature would allow users to leave reviews for books they've read.

2. **Collaborative Features**: Introduce collaboration functionalities, allowing users to connect with friends, share wishlists, and recommend books to each other. Enhancements will include a friendship system and the ability to share wishlists exclusively with friends, fostering a sense of community and interaction among users.

Incorporating these features will further enrich the BookWish experience, fostering a vibrant and collaborative community of book enthusiasts.

# Project Goals 
The concept for the BookWish website stemmed from observing the needs of my book-loving family and friends. As avid readers, they constantly seek out new books, discovering titles they're drawn to but often face challenges in obtaining or reading them. Additionally, they struggle to keep track of their growing list of desired reads. I've witnessed friends excitedly stumble upon a book they fancy, only to forget about it later due to lack of a tracking system. Recognizing this common dilemma among readers, I envisioned BookWish as a solution, empowering users to effortlessly compile and manage their book wishlist in one convenient platform.

## User Goals 
* Seamlessly create and manage a personalized wishlist of books they want to read or buy.

## Site Owner Goals 
* Provide an intuitive and enjoyable platform for users to curate their book wishlist.
* Ensure the website is interactive, responsive, and accessible across various devices.

# User Experience 
## Target Audience 
BookWish caters to avid readers and book enthusiasts who seek a centralized platform to organize their reading preferences and track desired books.

## User Requirements and Expectations 
* A simple, intuitive navigation system.
* Smooth functionality of links and buttons.
* Accessibility 

## User Stories 
1.  **Understanding the Site:** As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the site and navigate it easily.
2.  **Registration:** As a user, I want to register for an account.
3.  **Login:** As a user, I want to log into my account.
4.  **Adding Books:** As a user, I want to easily add books to my wishlist.
5.  **Editing Books:** As a user, I want to be able to edit the details of books I have added to my wishlist.
6.  **Deleting Books:** As a user, I want to have the option to remove books from my wishlist.
